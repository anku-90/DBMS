Employee( emp_id, dept_idemp_name, DoJ, salary, commission,job_title)
1. Consider the schema given above. Keep the commission column empty initially. Write a Stored Procedure to
record the employee commission based on following conditions. If salary is more than 10000 then commission
is 0.4%, if Salary is less than 10000 but experience is more than 10 years then 0.35%, if salary is less than 3000
then commission is 0.25%. In the remaining cases commission is 0.15%.
2. Write a PLSQL Function that takes department ID and returns the name of the manager of the department.



1.  
create table EMPLOYEES(emp_id int,salary int,commission int,DOJ varchar(20));

insert into EMPLOYEES values(1,100000,0,'2011-1-2'); 

CREATE OR REPLACE PROCEDURE RecordEmployeeCommission (emp_id IN NUMBER, salary IN NUMBER, DoJ IN DATE) IS
  commission_rate NUMBER;
BEGIN
  IF salary > 10000 THEN
    commission_rate := 0.004; -- 0.4%
  ELSIF salary <= 10000 AND (SYSDATE - DoJ) >= 3652 THEN
    commission_rate := 0.0035; -- 0.35%
  ELSIF salary < 3000 THEN
    commission_rate := 0.0025; -- 0.25%
  ELSE
    commission_rate := 0.0015; -- 0.15%
  END IF;
  
  -- Insert the commission record into the commission column for the employee.
  UPDATE EMPLOYEES
  SET commission = salary * commission_rate
  WHERE emp_id = emp_id;
  
END;

begin
RecordEmployeeCommission(1,100000,'1-1-2');
end

select * from EMPLOYEES;

2.CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION GetDepartmentManager (dept_id IN NUMBER) RETURN VARCHAR2 IS
  manager_name VARCHAR2(50);
BEGIN
  SELECT emp_name INTO manager_name
  FROM Employee
  WHERE dept_id = dept_id AND job_title = 'Manager';
  RETURN manager_name;
END;
