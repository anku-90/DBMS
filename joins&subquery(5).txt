Consider Following Schema
Employee (Employee_id, First_name, Last_name , Hire_date, Salary, Job_title, Manager_id, department_id)
Departments(Department_id, Department_name, Manager_id, Location_id)
Locations(Location_id , Street_address , Postal_code, city, state, Country_id)
Manager(Manager_id, Manager_name)
Create the tables with referential integrity.Solve following queries using joins and subqueries.
1. Write a query to find the names (first_name, last_name), the salary of the employees who earn more than
the average salary and who works in any of the IT departments.
2. Write a query to find the names (first_name, last_name), the salary of the employees who earn the same
salary as the minimum salary for all departments.
3. Write a query to display the employee ID, first name, last names, salary of all employees whose salary is
above average for their departments.
4. Write a query to display the department name, manager name, and city.
5. Write a query to display the name (first_name, last_name), hire date, salary of all managers whose
experience is more than 15 years.
